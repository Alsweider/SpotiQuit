# Virus Protection

Security software like [SmartScreen](https://www.pcworld.com/article/406832/how-to-get-past-windows-defender-smartscreen-in-windows-10.html) in Windows Defender and other antivirus programmes are often overly cautious with small and lesser-known software projects (especially if you don't buy a code signing certificate for around 500 DM from Microsoft). To assess the security of a programme, we recommend a scan with [Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com), where a large number of scanners check the uploaded file. For secure files, the vast majority of scanners should generally signal "undetected". Individual false detections (so-called false positives) occur again and again, even with the most harmless programmes, because virus scanners use different detection methods.
