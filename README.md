# How-to

- Use the button on top to restart Spotify and resume playback. You can also use the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl+Alt+S" to achieve the same, as long as the programme is open or minimised.
- If Spotify doesn't resume playback: increase the delay value, e.g. to 150 or 200 ms.
- "its not even an RPG at all! i mean look at it! in what way is this supposed to be an RPG if you can do quests and stuff? all you do is press one butten the entier time!" ([Axman13](https://youtu.be/4Z2Z23SAFVA))

# Virus Protection

Security software like [SmartScreen](https://www.pcworld.com/article/406832/how-to-get-past-windows-defender-smartscreen-in-windows-10.html) in Windows Defender and other antivirus programmes are often overly cautious with small and lesser-known software projects (especially if you don't buy a code signing certificate for around 500 DM from Microsoft). To assess the security of a programme, we recommend a scan with [Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com), where a large number of scanners check the uploaded file. For secure files, the vast majority of scanners should generally signal "undetected". Individual false detections (so-called false positives) occur again and again, even with the most harmless programmes, because virus scanners use different detection methods.
